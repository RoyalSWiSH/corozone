# Corozone


## Goals
- decrease number of contacts outside of their regular social circle
- help older people without access to internet -> let children, nephews add requests for other people
- decrease workload for emergency hotline by providing assitance for self diagnosis using the app 
- decrease workload on hospitals, emergency sites by signaling to the user where resources, beds, oxygen... 
are available and when they do not need to visit a doctor or facility
- educate layman to collect test samples and send them to a testing facility (?)
- allow testing facilities to report results to the user via the app and forward the data to gesundheitsamt

## Outside help

- contacts to doctors to evaluate symptoms when a user does not need to call emergency hotline
- contact to epidemiologist to make sure we don't increase contacts by helping neighbours
- contacts to medical facilities to let them provide their utilization rate
- contacts to international organisation (RKI, WHO...). Apple does not allow any third party corona related apps, needs to be vetted.
